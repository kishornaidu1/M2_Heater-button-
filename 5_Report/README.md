# Objective of this project
To check the status of the Button Sensor i.e whether a passenger have been seated or not.
To check the status of Heater button (ON or OFF)

# overview of this project
the design and simulation of an Automatic Heater Control system. This system allows the user to set a desired temperature which is then compared to the temperature measured by a temperature sensor.

# Introduction
heater button is an electrical component that responds to light. When light rays strike it, the resistance changes very instantly. An LDR's resistance levels can vary by several orders of magnitude. When the light level rises, the resistance value decreases. In the dark, the resistance of LDR is several megaohms, whereas in strong light, it is only a few hundred ohms. As a result of the resistance change, these resistors are widely used in a variety of applications. The wavelength of the incident light also affects the LDR sensitivity. The light-sensitive features of LDRs can be achieved by developing them with semiconductor materials. Despite the fact that CdS (cadmium sulphide) is the most well-known substance utilised in this resistor.

# COMPONENTS AND SUPPLIES
* ATMega328
* Voltage Source
* Connecting wires
* LED's
* Resistor

# Advantages and Disadvantages

# Advantages

* It's simple to combine with heating systems like automatic heating.
* It is used to reduce energy consumption or manage energy by controlling the brightness level of mobile phones and turning on and off street lights based on the amount of ambient light.
* The operation of light sensors necessitates a low voltage and power supply.
* Photoresistors are less expensive, bi-directional, and have a medium response time.

# Disadvantages

* Photoresistor resistance varies continuously (analogue) and is rough in character.
* Phototransistors are not able to withstand voltages more than 1000 volts.
* Surges, spikes, and EM energy can damage phototransistors.
